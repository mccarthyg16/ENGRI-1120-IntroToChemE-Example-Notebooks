    "### Introduction\n",
    "Suppose we have a reaction set $\\mathcal{R}$ involving the species set $\\mathcal{M}$ that is occurring in a well-mixed chemical reactor with stream set $\\mathcal{S}$. Then the concentration of component $i\\in\\mathcal{M}$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(C_{i}V\\right) = \\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}v_{s}C_{s,i}\\dot{V}_{s} + \\sum_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\sigma_{ir}\\hat{r}_{r}V\\qquad\\forall{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C_{s,i}$ denotes the concentration of component $i\\in\\mathcal{M}$ in stream $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$, $\\sigma_{ir}$ denotes the stoichiometric coefficient for component $i\\in\\mathcal{M}$ in reaction $r\\in\\mathcal{R}$, $\\dot{V}_{s}$ denotes the volumetric flow rate of stream $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$, $V$ denotes the volume of the reaction mixture in the reactor unit, $v_{s}$ denotes the direction parameter for stream $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$ and the quantity $C_{i}$ denotes the concentration of component $i\\in\\mathcal{M}$ in the reaction vessel. Finally, the terms $\\hat{r}_{r}$ denote the _reaction rate per unit volume_ for reaction $r\\in\\mathcal{R}$ that is occurring in the reaction vessel. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constant volume, steady-state:\n",
    "When the reaction is at constant volume, we can pull the volume $V$ out of the accumulation term and divide by the volume to give:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}v_{s}C_{s,i}D_{s} + \\sum_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\sigma_{ir}\\hat{r}_{r}\\qquad\\forall{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D_{s}$ is called the _dilution rate_ for stream $s\\in\\mathcal{S}$; the dilution rate has units of inverse time. Finally, at steady-state, all accumulation terms vanish, giving:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{S}}v_{s}C_{s,i}D_{s} + \\sum_{r\\in\\mathcal{R}}\\sigma_{ir}\\hat{r}_{r} = 0\\qquad\\forall{i}\\in\\mathcal{M}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem setup and assumptions\n",
    "Let's do some calculations for the reactor shown in Fig. 1; an irreversible liquid phase reaction occurs, which converts $A$ and $B$ into product $P$ according to the reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2A+B\\longrightarrow{P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "at the rate $\\hat{r}_{1}$ (units: mol/volume-time). The volume of the reaction mixture $V$ = 5L. Stream 1 has a volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}_{1}$ = 200 mL/h and Stream 2 has a volumetric flow rate $\\dot{V}_{2}$ = 300 mL/h. The concentration(s) of $A$ in the stream 1 is $C_{1,1}$ = 50 mmol/L, there is no $B$ and $C$ in stream $1$. The concentration(s) of $B$ in the stream 2 is $C_{2,2}$ = 75 mmol/L, there is no $A$ or $C$ in stream $2$. The rate constant for rate $1$ is given by: $k_{1}$ = 0.56 units. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Assumptions__:\n",
    "* The reactor is well-mixed\n",
    "* The rate of reaction for $\\hat{r}_{1}$ follows mass action kinetics\n",
    "* Let A = index 1, B = index 2 and C = index 3"
